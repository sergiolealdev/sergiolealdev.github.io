###How to install

Just clone this repository, and run `bower install` to create the directory with the dependencies of the project.

You may also want to run install http-server with `npm install -g http-server` to have a little HTTP Server to run the app. Once installed, you just have to run `http-server` in the directory of the app in order to run the content in the server.
